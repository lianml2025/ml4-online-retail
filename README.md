# 🛍️ ML4 Online Retail Case Study

Machine learning model for customer segmentation using the [Online Retail dataset](https://archive.ics.uci.edu/dataset/352/online+retail).

---

## 📌 Project Overview

Clustering: How do customers cluster based on their purchasing behavior (eg., product quantities, unit prices, and transaction frequency)

This project explores unsupervised learning techniques to cluster customers based on purchasing behavior - including product quantities, unit prices, and transaction frequency.


**Dataset Summary:**  
This transactional dataset contains all purchases made between 01/12/2010 and 09/12/2011 by customers of a UK-based online retailer specializing in unique all-occasion gifts. Many customers are wholesalers.

## 🎯 Objectives & Success Criteria

- Identify meaningful customer clusters using unsupervised learning
- Evaluate clustering quality using metrics like silhouette score and intra-cluster variance
- Ensure reproducibility and interpretability of the pipeline
- Document ethical considerations and potential biases
