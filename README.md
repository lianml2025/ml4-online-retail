# 🛍️ Machine Learning Online Retail Case Study

Machine learning model for customer segmentation using the [Online Retail dataset](https://archive.ics.uci.edu/dataset/352/online+retail).

---

## 📌 Project Overview

This project applies unsupervised learning techniques to segment customers based on purchasing behavior using Recency, Frequency, and Monetary (RFM) metrics derived from a year’s worth of transactional data from a UK-based online retailer. The dataset includes over 541,000 records, capturing product quantities, unit prices, invoice dates, and customer locations. Our goal is to identify meaningful customer segments and form well-separated, stable clusters that reflect real behavioral patterns across both retail and wholesale buyers.

These insights will help the business better understand customer profitability and tailor strategies accordingly. By turning complex purchasing data into interpretable visualizations and summaries, the project delivers actionable insights accessible to both technical and non-technical stakeholders.

**Dataset Summary:**  
This transactional dataset contains all purchases made between 01/12/2010 and 09/12/2011 by customers of a UK-based online retailer specializing in unique all-occasion gifts. Many customers are wholesalers. The raw dataset has about 541909 records with eight fields:InvoiceNo, StockCode, Description, Quantity, InvoiceDate, UnitPrice, CustomerID, Country.                         


## 🎯 Objectives & Success Criteria

### Dataset Precessing Summary
After our data cleaning, the records in the dataset go down to: 538,945[528,560 with cancelation] from the original: 541,909 records, each for a particular item contained in a
transaction. We added four new columns: Year, Month, Subtotal and CancellationFlat for advance data analysis, and the dataset goes from the original 8 columns to 12 columns. By including new columns, we improve the dataset without modifying the value of the original fields. Therefore we are confident that our data cleaning preserves the characteristic of the original dataset.

### Exploratory Analysis


We used SQLite to extract revelant information for our analysis:

- Total number of valid of transactions after data cleaning:
  19,745 valid transactions. It suggested that average number of distinct products contained in each transaction was 26 (=528,560/19,745). This seemed to suggest that many of the consumers of the business were organizational customers rather than individual customers. Also the majority of the sales were from United Kingdom with 17,863 transactions and total sales of 8.6 million pounds. And the top sale product was "WORLD WAR 2 GLIDERS ASSTD DESIGNS" with a total sales of 54,903 pounds.

- Correlation between quantity and unit price
  #feature_analysis file under experiments folder
  #plot image for support in the support images folder

Our initial correlation model showed a correlation value between Quantity and UnitPrice of: -0.0209, which was a weak correlation. There is virtually no linear relationship between Quantity and UnitPrice. A small negative correlation (–0.0209) suggests that, on average, buying more items is very slightly associated with lower unit prices. However, this was a bit counterintuitive and not meaningful based on normal business sense. When we plotted Quantity and UnitPrice chart, we saw there were a couple of high value transactions with lower number of transactions and majority of transactions were at the smaller values, this may explain why without price segmentation, initial correction model showed a weak correlation between unit price and quantity. From the business point of view, these transactions were valid as they were genuine transaction records; however, they may be outliers from the data analysis point of view, and we may need to treat them separately.

### Feature Selection

- RFM (Recency, Frequency, Monetary) and Aggregated purchase behavior per customer for feature engineering
  
Here we also conducted RFM analysis to group customers based on how they shop: Recency, Frequency and Monetary. This helped to understand customers’ buying habits so that business owners can identify who their best and most loyal customers were.
1) Recency represented: How long it’s been since the customer last made a purchase. Customers who bought something recently get higher scores: 5 = very recent, 1 = very old.
2) Frequency represented: How often the customer makes a purchase. People who buy more often get higher scores: 5 = frequent buyer, 1 = rare.
3) Monetary represent: How much money the customer has spent in total. Customers who spend more get higher scores: 5 = high spender, 1 = low spender.

For each customer, we scored their Recency, Frequency and Monetary from 1 to 5: 5 meant the customer performed very well on that measure, 1 meant the customer performed poorly on that measure. 
The we ranked each customer based on their total RFM score: Recency score + Frequency score + Monetary score. Below tables showed the samples RFM results and how to intepret it.

| CustomerID | Recency | Frequency | Monetary | RFM Score | Interpretation                          |
|------------|---------|-----------|----------|-----------|------------------------------------------|
| 12347      | 2       | 7         | £4,310.00| 5-5-5     | Best customer: recent, frequent, high spender |
| 12348      | 75      | 4         | £1,797.24| 2-4-4     | Good spender, moderately active        |
| 12349      | 19      | 1         | £1,757.55| 4-1-4     | High spender, but infrequent           |
| 12350      | 310     | 1         | £334.40  | 1-1-2     | Dormant and low value                 |
| 12352      | 36      | 7         | £2,385.71| 3-5-5     | Active and valuable                    |


## 🤖 Initial Model Development

### Algorithms Explored
- K-Means 
- DBSCAN

By transforming raw transactional data into structured RFM features and applying unsupervised learning, we can identify distinct customer groups that inform marketing, inventory planning, and strategic outreach.

To achieve this, we first engineered RFM features and implemented 2 separated models (K-Means and DBSCAN) to compare customer behaviours, using both the Elbow Method and Silhouette Score to determine the optimal number of clusters. 

However, one customer 'guest-United Kingdom' exhibited extreme purchasing behavior, distorting the clustering results. Removing this outlier allowed for more balanced segmentation and clearer interpretation of typical customer patterns. 

To address this, a second model was run after excluding this outlier, resulting in more balanced clusters and clearer behavioral distinctions. This adjustment ensures that the segmentation reflects typical customer behavior improving interpretability and business relevance.

Together, these models provide a comprehensive view of customer diversity and purchasing dynamics, enabling more informed business decisions.

(Add images to compare improvements from baseline to second model)

## ✅ Conclusion and recommendations for the business

#### These three clusters help the business tailor its strategy:
 - Cluster 0 (low-value customers): use low-cost marketing or re-engagement campaigns without overspending on acquisition.
 - Cluster 1 (moderate customers): target with promotions to increase spending and move them toward high-value status.
 - Cluster 2 (high-value customers): prioritize with loyalty rewards and personalized offers to maximize retention and revenue.
#### Together, these insights allow the company to optimize marketing budget, improve retention, and increase profitability.

## ⚠️ Risks and Unknowns
- Missing IDs: A significant portion of transactions lack CustomerID, which introduces sampling bias. These anonymous purchases may represent one-time buyers, wholesale orders, or system errors.
- Returns Ignored: returns behavior is itself a valuable signal of customer satisfaction or fraud risk. Ignoring it may lead to overestimating customer value, especially for high-frequency buyers with high return rates.
- Outlier Impact: Extreme buyers distort clusters; removing them improves balance.
- Time Sensitivity: The dataset spans a single year, and customer behavior may shift seasonally or over time.

## 🧭 Ethical Considerations
- Country Targeting: Risk of bias or exclusion in location-based strategies.
- Fairness: Segments may lead to unequal treatment or missed opportunities.
- Transparency: Non-technical users need clear explanations of what clusters mean.
- Privacy: Even though the dataset is anonymized, we have to make sure to get the right  permission or disclosure.


## Future Work 
- Deployment of models on to the cloud using AWS or GCP. 
- Implement supervised models to identify loyal customers (will need to set some labeling prior model implementation). 
- Create interactive web platform for further analysis.
- Get more data for atleast 5 years to train the model for better results.
