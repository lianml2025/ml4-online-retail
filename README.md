# 🛍️ ML4 Online Retail Case Study

Machine learning model for customer segmentation using the [Online Retail dataset](https://archive.ics.uci.edu/dataset/352/online+retail).

---

## 📌 Project Overview

Clustering: We are to segment customers into meaningful behavioral groups based on their purchasing behavior(eg., product quantities, unit prices, and transaction frequency), country of origins etc.

This project explores both supervised and unsupervised learning techniques to cluster customers based on purchasing behavior: Recency, Frequency, and Monetary like product quantities, unit prices, and transaction frequency. It applies the machine learning techniques to the online retail dataset. Our goal is to identify meaningful customer segment and create well-separated stable clusters with balance segmentation. The project tries to identify different segments based on RFM metrics to reflect customer behaviour. The distinct customer groups characterized in the project can help the business better understand its products and customers in terms of their profitability. It also turns complex purchasing data into provide customer insights that are easy to interpret to non-technical user.



**Dataset Summary:**  
This transactional dataset contains all purchases made between 01/12/2010 and 09/12/2011 by customers of a UK-based online retailer specializing in unique all-occasion gifts. Many customers are wholesalers. The raw dataset has about 541909 records with eight fields:InvoiceNo, StockCode, Description, Quantity, InvoiceDate, UnitPrice, CustomerID, Country.                         


## 🎯 Objectives & Success Criteria

Objectives:
- Identify meaningful customer clusters using unsupervised learning
- Create well-separated stable clusters
- Evaluate clustering quality using metrics like silhouette score and intra-cluster variance
- Ensure reproducibility and interpretability of the pipeline
- Document ethical considerations and potential biases

Success Criteria:
-	Clustering achieves a Silhouette Score ≥ 0.6 with low intra-cluster variance
-	Clusters are clearly interpretable and meaningful to business
-	Reducible repreductivity with all preprocessing, feature scaling
-	Unbias segmentation

### Dataset Precessing Summary
After our data cleaning, the records in the dataset go down to: 540562 from the original: 541909 records, each for a particular item contained in a
transaction. We added four new columns: Year, Month, Subtotal and CancellationFlat for advance data analysis, and the dataset goes from the original 8 columns to 12 columns. By including new columns, we improve the dataset without modifying the value of the original fields. Therefore we are confident that our data cleaning preserves the characteristic of the original dataset.

### Exploratory Analysis

TODO (adjust and complete):

We used SQLite to extract revelant information for our analysis:

- Total number of valid of transactions after data cleaning:
  20,524 valid transactions. It suggested that average number of distinct products contained in each transaction was 26.3 (=540,562/20,524). This seemed to suggest that many of the consumers of the business were organizational customers rather than individual customers. Also the majority of the sales were from United Kingdom with 18,628 transactions and total sales of 8.6 million pounds. And the top sale product was "WORLD WAR 2 GLIDERS ASSTD DESIGNS" with a total sales of 54,999 pounds.

- Correlation between quantity and unit price
  #feature_analysis file under experiments folder
  #plot image for support in the support images folder

Our initial correlation model showed a correlation value between Quantity and UnitPrice of: -0.0209, which was a weak correlation. There is virtually no linear relationship between Quantity and UnitPrice. A small negative correlation (–0.0209) suggests that, on average, buying more items is very slightly associated with lower unit prices. However, this was a bit counterintuitive and not meaningful based on normal business sense. When we plotted Quantity and UnitPrice chart, we saw there were a couple of high value transactions with lower number of transactions and majority of transactions were at the smaller values, this may explain why without price segmentation, initial correction model showed a weak correlation between unit price and quantity. From the business point of view, these transactions were valid as they were genuine transaction records; however, they may be outliers from the data analysis point of view, and we may need to treat them separately.

- RFM (Recency, Frequency, Monetary) analysis for feature engineering
  
Here we also conducted RFM analysis to group customers based on how they shop: Recency, Frequency and Monetary. This helped to understand customers’ buying habits so that business owners can identify who their best and most loyal customers were.
1) Recency represented: How long it’s been since the customer last made a purchase. Customers who bought something recently get higher scores: 5 = very recent, 1 = very old.
2) Frequency represented: How often the customer makes a purchase. People who buy more often get higher scores: 5 = frequent buyer, 1 = rare.
3) Monetary represent: How much money the customer has spent in total. Customers who spend more get higher scores: 5 = high spender, 1 = low spender.

For each customer, we scored their Recency, Frequency and Monetary from 1 to 5: 5 meant the customer performed very well on that measure, 1 meant the customer performed poorly on that measure. 
The we ranked each customer based on their total RFM score: Recency score + Frequency score + Monetary score. Below tables showed the samples RFM results and how to intepret it.

| CustomerID | Recency | Frequency | Monetary | RFM Score | Interpretation                          |
|------------|---------|-----------|----------|-----------|------------------------------------------|
| 12347      | 2       | 7         | £4,310.00| 5-5-5     | Best customer: recent, frequent, high spender |
| 12348      | 75      | 4         | £1,797.24| 2-4-4     | Good spender, moderately active        |
| 12349      | 19      | 1         | £1,757.55| 4-1-4     | High spender, but infrequent           |
| 12350      | 310     | 1         | £334.40  | 1-1-2     | Dormant and low value                 |
| 12352      | 36      | 7         | £2,385.71| 3-5-5     | Active and valuable                    |
